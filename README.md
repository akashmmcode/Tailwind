## Description

Welcome to FrontConf, a Tailwind CSS practice project! FrontConf is a fictional conference website that showcases my skills with Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework. In this project, I've created a responsive and visually appealing landing page for a conference event, complete with a subscription form for email notifications.

The main goal of this project is to demonstrate how Tailwind CSS can be used to build clean and attractive user interfaces quickly and efficiently. By exploring this project's codebase, you can get insights into various Tailwind CSS utility classes and design patterns used to craft this conference landing page.
